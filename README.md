This repository contains mods I made for [Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz HD](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061730/Super_Monkey_Ball_Banana_Blitz_HD/). All the mods here require the use of [BananaModManager](https://github.com/MorsGames/BananaModManager), which I also made.

## Mods

- [FreeCam]() (bbhd.mors.freecam)
  Allows you to freely manipulate the in-game camera using the keyboard. You can toggle it by pressing the 'TAB' key.

- [Graphical Tweaks]() (bbhd.mors.graphicaltweaks)
  Allows you to change many settings related to the games graphics and camera.

- ["Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz REMASTERED]() (bbhd.mors.bbremastered)
  A joke mod that ruins the game's visuals. I'm not sorry.

All the mods here are licensed under GPLv3. Pull requests and whatnot are welcome!
